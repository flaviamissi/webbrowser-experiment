What's this about?

The idea is to learn a little more of C++, to do that I'm going through this "browser".
Maybe what it comes is not useful at all, just as a proof of concept (or something).

The current idea is just to show an HTML page content with some terminal formatting based on its HTML.
Although simple, this approach is powerful because doesn't involves any external tools, such HTML, CSS,
and Javascript rendering. This approach is just simple enough. I've learned about how to use the cURL C++ API,
and now I'm doing some converting code based on HTML tags, so I'm stretching logic too.
